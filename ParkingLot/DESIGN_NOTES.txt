PARKING LOT SYSTEM - DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS
============================================

ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW:

1. PACKAGES:
   - main: Core parking lot logic (ParkingLot, ParkingSpot, Ticket, Admin, Attendant)
   - main.vehicle: Vehicle types (Vehicle, VehicleType, Bike, Car, Truck)
   - main.parkingstrategy: Parking spot finding strategies
   - main.payment: Payment processing and pricing strategies
   - main.exception: Custom exception classes

2. KEY IMPROVEMENTS:

   A. THREAD-SAFE SINGLETON
      - Double-checked locking implementation
      - Volatile keyword for memory visibility
      - Thread-safe parking lot access

   B. TIMESTAMPING
      - Entry time recorded at parking
      - Exit time recorded at unparking
      - LocalDateTime for precision

   C. PARKING SPOT IDENTIFICATION
      - Unique spot numbers (1, 2, 3, ...)
      - Spot type (BIKE, CAR, TRUCK)
      - Spot occupancy tracking

   D. PAYMENT PROCESSING
      - Abstract PricingStrategy interface
      - Multiple implementations:
        * HourlyPricingStrategy - Minimal 1-hour charge
        * MinuteBasedPricingStrategy - Per-minute billing
        * FlatRatePricingStrategy - Fixed amount
      - Automatic fee calculation on unpark
      - Total revenue tracking

   E. VEHICLE TRACKING
      - Vehicles mapped by license plate
      - Prevents duplicate parking
      - Quick lookup on unpark
      - Current parked vehicles count

   F. TICKET SYSTEM
      - Unique ticket IDs
      - Complete entry/exit workflow
      - Amount charged stored in ticket
      - Detailed ticket printing

   G. ERROR HANDLING
      - Custom exception classes:
        * ParkingException (base)
        * NoSpotAvailableException
        * VehicleNotParkedException
        * InvalidPaymentException
      - Proper validation throughout

   H. ADMIN FUNCTIONALITY
      - Add parking spots with IDs
      - Set pricing strategy
      - Set spot-finding strategy
      - Display parking lot status
      - View capacity metrics

   I. ATTENDANT RESPONSIBILITIES
      - Park vehicles
      - Unpark vehicles with payment
      - Collect total payments
      - Report parking status

   J. PARKING STATUS REPORTING
      - Total spots count
      - Occupied spots count
      - Available spots count
      - Real-time capacity view

3. DESIGN PATTERNS USED:

   - Singleton: ParkingLot (thread-safe)
   - Strategy: FindSpotStrategy (spot finding)
   - Strategy: PricingStrategy (fee calculation)
   - Facade: Admin (simplified access)
   - Template Method: Vehicle hierarchy

4. EXTENSIBILITY:

   Easy to add:
   - New vehicle types (extend Vehicle)
   - New spot-finding strategies (implement FindSpotStrategy)
   - New pricing models (implement PricingStrategy)
   - New payment processors
   - Logging and reporting features

5. COMPLETE WORKFLOW:

   1. Admin sets up parking lot
      - Add spots with IDs and types
      - Configure pricing strategy
      - Configure spot-finding strategy
   
   2. Attendant parks vehicle
      - Ticket created with entry time
      - Spot marked as occupied
      - Vehicle tracked by license plate
   
   3. Attendant unparks vehicle
      - Exit time recorded
      - Fee calculated based on duration
      - Spot marked as free
      - Payment processed
      - Revenue collected

6. PRODUCTION-READY FEATURES:

   ✓ Thread-safe implementation
   ✓ Proper exception handling
   ✓ Payment processing
   ✓ Timestamp tracking
   ✓ Vehicle identification
   ✓ Status reporting
   ✓ Extensible architecture
   ✓ Clean code organization
   ✓ No code comments (self-documenting)
